An even more complex topic is orchestrating the acquisition of custom-built hardware setups for cutting-edge scientific projects.
The desire to have a flexible framework for building custom applications for microscopy is strong in the community, but there is yet no way to find a reacheable consensus

The following sections illustrate the decision-making process that led to the conception of RedSun.
