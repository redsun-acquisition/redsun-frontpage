# Bluesky

The [Bluesky framework] is described as:

> a collection of Python libraries that are co-developed but independently useful and may be adopted *a la carte*.

It was developed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), in the Brookhaven National Laboratories, Uptown, New York, USA.

The goal is to provide carefully defined software interfaces, where any given piece may be used, extended or replaced.

At the centerpiece of the framework is [bluesky], an acquisition engine for experiment specification and orchestration.
